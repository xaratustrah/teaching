A super rich customer wants to have a circular particle accelerator for their 8[m] by 8[m] living room for showing off how he can accelerate 40-Ca-1+ ions to 100 [AMeV] to their guests when they come for playing poker on Tuesday evenings. He tells you that he is planning to buy the biggest magnets in the market which has 1.5 [T]\n",

Your boss asks you to reconsider the charge state of the Calcium beam so that the size will be the smallest of this configuration. You do the calculation and see that the situation is actually much better. Please provide these calculations and explain in your own words what the effect of changing the charge state is."
